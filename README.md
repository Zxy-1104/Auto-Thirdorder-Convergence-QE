Auto-Thirdorder-Convergence-QE-Workflow 🚀
An intelligent automation suite for High-Throughput Third-Order Force Constant Calculations.

This project is designed for researchers in thermal transport and phonon physics. It streamlines the complex workflow of generating supercells, calculating third-order force constants (using Quantum Espresso), and computing thermal conductivity (using ShengBTE).

By identifying rotationally and translationally equivalent supercells, this workflow significantly reduces computational cost (Core-Hours) and automates the convergence test regarding interaction cutoff distances.

🌟 Key Features
(1) Intelligent Deduplication: Automatically detects equivalent supercell structures generated by thirdorder.py and creates symbolic links, skipping redundant SCF calculations.

(2) Cost Savings Analysis: Includes a dedicated script to calculate and report exact savings in Core-Hours and job counts, visualizing the efficiency of your grid.

(3) Robust HPC Integration: Optimized for Slurm clusters. Uses Job Arrays for massive throughput and includes auto-correction for common QE input formatting errors (e.g., "sticky numbers" fix).

(4) Automated Convergence: Automatically aggregates thermal conductivity results (Kappa) across different supercell sizes and cutoff distances to assist in convergence checks.

(5) Resume Capability: Smartly skips completed or running jobs to prevent resource wastage.
